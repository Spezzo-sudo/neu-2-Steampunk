# Alliance Components Guidelines
- Mirror the hierarchy of the alliance store; pass identifiers instead of entire store slices when possible.
- Document every exported component with concise JSDoc including the expected permissions context.
- Keep pact and notes rendering modular so they can later be extracted without major refactoring.
